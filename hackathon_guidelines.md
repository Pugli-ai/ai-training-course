# Lesson 4 Hackathon Guidelines
*Objective*: Create a Django app that allows users to ask question about very technical papers on ChatGPT and prompting techniques.
## Hackathon Guidelines
Start from the Django app already implemented during this lesson. 
You should just modify the function `handle_message` in `django_langchain_app/chat_bot.py` to add the logic to handle the questions about the papers.

The papers are in the folder `documents/hackathon`.
